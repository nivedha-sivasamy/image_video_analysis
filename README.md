## Introduction

Image and video analysis involves a wide range of techniques for processing, manipulating, and extracting information from visual data. This repository provides Python implementations of various image and video analysis methods, from basic operations to advanced image classification.

## Image Analysis

### Resize and Rotate

Programs for resizing and rotating images, which are fundamental image transformation operations.

### Contrast Stretching

Enhance the contrast of images to improve their visual quality and feature visibility.

### Image Enhancement

Apply various image enhancement techniques to improve image quality and visual appearance.

### Non-Linear Spatial Filter

Perform non-linear spatial filtering operations to highlight specific image features.

### Homomorphic Filter

Apply the homomorphic filter to enhance images by adjusting their illumination and reflectance.

### Wavelet Compression

Implement wavelet-based image compression techniques to reduce image file size.

### Wavelet Decomposition and Reconstruction

Decompose images into wavelet coefficients and reconstruct images from these coefficients.

### Feature Descriptors

Extract feature descriptors using techniques like Harris corner detection, SIFT, and ORB.

## Video Analysis

Extract frames from videos to analyze individual frames or perform further processing. Change the speed of videos to create fast-motion, slow-motion, reversed, or mixed videos.

## Advanced Image Classification

### Using OpenCV DNN Module

Perform advanced image classification using the OpenCV Deep Neural Networks (DNN) module, which includes pre-trained models.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code for each image and video analysis technique in their respective directories. You can use these implementations as reference, integrate them into your projects, or use them for learning and experimentation.
